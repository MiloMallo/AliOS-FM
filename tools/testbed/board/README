This folder contains all board support files.

To interface a new borad to testbed, you need to:
 1. get the board name--DEVNAME--by running AliOS Things 'devname' command in board shell, e.g.: MK3060
 2. make a folder with its name to be devname (=lowercase(DEVNAME)), e.g.: mk3060
 3. write a python script named devname.py (e.g.: mk3060.py), put it in ./devname folder, implement the following three functions:
     def erase(port)
     def program(port, address, file)
     def control(port, operation)
    also put the related tools in ./devname folder
